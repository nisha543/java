XYZ Technologies is in the process of increment the salary of the employees. This
increment is done based on their salary and their performance appraisal rating.
If the appraisal rating is between 1 and 3, the increment is 10% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is between 3.1 and 4, the increment is 25% of the salary.
If the appraisal rating is between 4.1 and 5, the increment is 30% of the salary.
Help them to do this, by writing a program that displays the incremented salary. Write a
class “IncrementCalculation.java” and write the main method in it.
Note : If either the salary is 0 or negative (or) if the appraisal rating is not in the range 1 to
5 (inclusive), then the output should be “Invalid Input”.

Problem Statement – Write a program to calculate the fuel consumption of your
truck.The program should ask the user to enter the quantity of diesel to fill up the
tank and the distance covered till the tank goes dry.Calculate the fuel consumption
and display it in the format (liters per 100 kilometers).
Convert the same result to the U.S. style of miles per gallon and display the result. If
the quantity or distance is zero or negative display ” is an Invalid Input”.
[Note: The US approach of fuel consumption calculation (distance / fuel) is the
inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance ). Also note that 1 kilometer is
0.6214 miles, and 1 liter is 0.2642 gallons.]
The result should be with two decimal place.To get two decimal place refer the
below-mentioned print statement :

float cost=670.23;
System.out.printf(“You need a sum of Rs.%.2f to cover the trip”,cost);
Sample Input 1:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
20
Enter the distance covered
150
Sample Output 1:
Liters/100KM
13.33
Miles/gallons
17.64
Explanation:
For 150 KM fuel consumption is 20 liters,
Then for 100 KM fuel consumption would be (20/150)*100=13.33,
Distance is given in KM, we have to convert it to miles (150*0.6214)=93.21,
Fuel consumption is given in liters, we have to convert it to gallons
(20*0.2642)=5.284,
Then find (miles/gallons)=(93.21/5.284)=17.64
Sample Input 2:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
-5
Sample Output 2:
-5 is an Invalid Input
Sample Input 3:
Enter the no of liters to fill the tank
